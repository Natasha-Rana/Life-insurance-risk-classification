![enter image description here](https://github.com/Natasha-Rana/Life-insurance-risk-classification/blob/main/illustration-of-life-insurance.jpg?raw=true)
This project was created as a part of INSAID Capstone to **develop a predictive model** that **accurately assigns risk class** to every **life insurance applicant.** This will help in  **improving the life insurance application process** by making it **quicker** and **less labor intensive** for **new and existing customers to get a quote.**

The  **data**  was  **sourced**  from an  **open-source(csv file)**  containing records of  ** Id, age, weight, height, BMI, Employment Info, Insured Info, Insurance History, Family History, Medical History, Medical Keyword, Response of the life insurance applicant.

In this  **project,**  we will **predict** and **classify** our  **customers** into **two risk classes** i.e., **Standard risk class(1), Non-standard risk class(0).**

**Standard risk class** implies that the **customer** would **pay standard premium rates.** Whereas, **non-standard risk** implies that a **customer** will **either pay higher premium or lower premium** **depending upon** their **current health conditions** and **possibility of any morbid diseases in future like high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes etc.**
